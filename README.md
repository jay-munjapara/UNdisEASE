# Idea:

- The primary target of this project is to foster a web application which utilizes a few data mining algorithms. 

- The framework takes the symptoms from the clients which they are feeling at that point and runs a Machine Learning algorithm in the cloud to recognize the disease from which the client might be suffering. 

- The System gathers crude data from the client and compares the diagnosis done by their primary care physicians and the related data which is now present on the web. 

- It also provides a way to contact specific specialists on an emergency case with just one click on our dashboard. 

- The framework utilizes the provided information from the client and matches the symptoms previously put away in the data set. 

# Approach:

- **Step 1**: Making an easy to use interface so that patient can easily diagnose and have a free check to ensure about the severity of the disease .  
- **Step 2**: After the diagnose check the patient can also book an appointment with doctor, can contact near by hospitals for empty beds or directly call the hospital incase of any emergency.
- **Step 3**: Developing a probabilistic modeling and deep learning approach (XGBoost) for Disease Prediction. It runs effectively on extensive databases of healthcare. 
- **Step 4**: Here in the APP **“ UNdisEASE | for you to be @ EASE ”** we have two different login options where one user is the doctor and other is patient. 

# Features:

Our project offers three main features which includes Diagnosis, Appointment and Emergency Help?. Detailed overview is given below:

- **Diagnosis**: User proposes his symptoms, and will be suggested predicted diseases with further detailed symptoms list to select one with most similar symptoms. Now by selecting the severity of the symptoms, proper care plans, bed allotment and cost estimation would be suggested.
- **Appointment** : Here if the patient has already finished his diagnosis then he can consult a doctor by clicking the appointment button.
- **Emergency Help?** : In this dashboard patients can directly have the contact number of hospitals who have registered in the app also an alert msg would also be sent to the ambulance at the same time.

# Feasibility: 

- Covid outbreak has affected the hospitality industry on a very big scale with disrupting the norm protocols resulting in bottlenecks for the services provided
- Patients wanting a diagnosis have to wait in long queues to get their checkup done. While still having a hesitation to visit such crowded areas.


# Tech Stack: 

- XGBOOST- is Model Training algorithm.

- HTML, CSS, JS- Frontend Development.

- SQLITE- Database Connectivity.

- Flask- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is the backend used in our Project.

- Heroku- Used for deploying our flask app via GitHub.
